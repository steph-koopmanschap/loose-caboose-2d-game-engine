# Loose Caboose GameEngine

The Loose Caboose GameEngine is not so much a game engine as it is a boiler plate or template code
for creating 2D games in Javascript with the HTML5 canvas.

Note that this is still a WIP (Work In Progress). As of now the engine is unworkable.

## Features

- Load assets (images, animations, sounds, music)
- 2D Collision detecton

### History

The code of Loose Caboose started with following projects:

- foodchain-simulator 
- Energy-Pulserator
- fungal-growth-sim

It was finally decided to put the base code of these projects into a seperate project and to optimize the code
for creating games. 
This project turned into Loose Caboose.
